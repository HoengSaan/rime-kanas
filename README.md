# Introduction

シリトリ学会假名入力

This is a schema designated for playing Shiritori(しりとり) fairly which is no text predication(予測入力) to impact the challengers.

I didn't do many change, the only thing I do is make the typing experience more similar to the ordinary input in the market(such as Microsoft Japanese IME).

You can type hiragana as normal, but you need to hold shift to type katakana in case I didn't change it. (Shiritori doesn't care you use either hiragana or katakana)

Beside playing Shiritori, you might can use this as an elementary tool to study Kana, and typing Japanese.
