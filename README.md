# Introduction

シリトリ学会假名入力

This is a schema basic on rime-kana, which is designated for playing Shiritori(しりとり) fairly which is no text predication(予測入力) to impact the challengers.

I didn't do many change to rime-kana, the only thing I do is make the typing experience more similar to the ordinary input in the market(such as Microsoft Japanese IME).
Just to mention it that I have add all the "phrase" in Microsoft Jpaanese IME that rime-kana hasn't featured because someone ask me.

You can type hiragana as normal, but you need to hold shift to type katakana in case I didn't change it. (Shiritori doesn't care you use either hiragana or katakana)

Beside playing Shiritori, you might can use this as an elementary tool to study Kana, and typing Japanese.

# Issues Faced

I don't how RIME work and I don't have any programming experience(. I didn't change the schema much (only algerba) because I don't want to break anything.

## Issue 1: Typing

In most of the Rime schema, you are type with space key becasue that how common Sino characters input (such as jyutping, luna-pinyin) work. However, It is not a case in Ordinary Japanese input. In fact, most of the Japanese input methods using space key to select and use enter key to type(you are not required to do use enter key to type, i just try to simplified the problem). 

## Issue 2: Smartphone Keyborad

This schema use some key to type specify words, it shouldn't be big issue.
However, If you can send me your keyboard design, I definitely appreciate that.
